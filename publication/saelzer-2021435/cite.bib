 abstract = {The friction in the contact zones during chip formation has a significant effect on tool wear and surface integrity. Especially the interaction of cooling lubricants and different surface preparations is rather unexplored. In the context of the present publication, the friction between tool and workpiece is therefore investigated in a special test under conditions close to machining for specific prepared tool surfaces when using a cooling lubricant. The results of the investigation are used to develop friction models depending on relative speed, surface preparation and intermediate medium, which will be implemented in new finite element formulations for chip formation simulation.},
