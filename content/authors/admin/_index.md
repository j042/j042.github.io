## About Me

Computational engineer with backgrounds in automation, and mechanical engineering. Currently, I am part of the research group Numerical Analysis and Design Methods at ILSB, TU Wien. My research focuses on solving strongly coupled multiphysics problems using spline-based methods and deep generative modeling of high fidelity simulation results, as well as geometries.
