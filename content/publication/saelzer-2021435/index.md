abstract: The friction in the contact zones during chip formation has a significant
  effect on tool wear and surface integrity. Especially the interaction of cooling
  lubricants and different surface preparations is rather unexplored. In the context
  of the present publication, the friction between tool and workpiece is therefore
  investigated in a special test under conditions close to machining for specific
  prepared tool surfaces when using a cooling lubricant. The results of the investigation
  are used to develop friction models depending on relative speed, surface preparation
  and intermediate medium, which will be implemented in new finite element formulations
  for chip formation simulation.
