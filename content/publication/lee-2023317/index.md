abstract: The modelling of friction is essential for the accuracy of chip formation
  simulations. Current models are not suitable to represent the influence of lubricants
  in interaction with different tool surfaces in its complexity. The present work
  aims on the development of a spline-based fluidstructure-contact interaction framework
  to model the friction of tool, chip and intermediate medium under various conditions.
  Using this framework, microscopic tribology simulations of the secondary shear zone
  can be performed to implement a friction coefficient distribution depending on relative
  speed, temperature and contact normal pressure into a chip formation simulation,
  which will be validated by experimental data.
