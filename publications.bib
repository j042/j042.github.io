abstract = {The modelling of friction is essential for the accuracy of chip formation simulations. Current models are not suitable to represent the influence of lubricants in interaction with different tool surfaces in its complexity. The present work aims on the development of a spline-based fluidstructure-contact interaction framework to model the friction of tool, chip and intermediate medium under various conditions. Using this framework, microscopic tribology simulations of the secondary shear zone can be performed to implement a friction coefficient distribution depending on relative speed, temperature and contact normal pressure into a chip formation simulation, which will be validated by experimental data.}

abstract = {The friction in the contact zones during chip formation has a significant effect on tool wear and surface integrity. Especially the interaction of cooling lubricants and different surface preparations is rather unexplored. In the context of the present publication, the friction between tool and workpiece is therefore investigated in a special test under conditions close to machining for specific prepared tool surfaces when using a cooling lubricant. The results of the investigation are used to develop friction models depending on relative speed, surface preparation and intermediate medium, which will be implemented in new finite element formulations for chip formation simulation.}
